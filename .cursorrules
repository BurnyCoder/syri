## Tech Stack
Python 3.12
Asyncio
uv for dependency management, use `uv sync`, `uv add <package>`, `uv remove <package>` and `uv run <script>`

### Dependencies
- assemblyai - Speech-to-text transcription
- browser-use - Browser automation and control
- elevenlabs - Text-to-speech synthesis
- langchain-anthropic - Claude LLM integration
- langchain-google-genai - Google AI models integration
- langchain-openai - OpenAI models integration
- portkey-ai - LLM API management and routing
- pyaudio - Audio recording and playback

### Spec

- External control of listening functionality:
  - Start/stop listening must be triggerable from outside the Python process (e.g., via shell scripts)
  - Support for remote device control through Karabiner/BetterTouchTool by executing shell/AppleScript commands


### /scripts/ Guidelines
 - Short, focused scripts
 - No fluff - no unnecessary comments, no error handling, no docs
 - Ideally import/reuse code from `src/`, so that scripts also serve as mini integration tests
 - Accept arguments from the command line
